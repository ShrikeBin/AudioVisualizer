### Plan is:

- make it display frequencies
- add function of +/- 10sec, and pause
- add queue function
- make it smooth

- add config for bins, refresh rate etc
- add tests - for instance what if we load .wav that is .mp3 and just changed the extension?
- integrate into workflows

- rewrite fft
- rewrite miniaudio
